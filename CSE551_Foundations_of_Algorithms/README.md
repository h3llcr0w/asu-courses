## Classwork for course CSE 551 - Foundations of Algorithms @ ASU

In this area, I will try to implement algorithms covered in class. Not trying to end up with the most optimized solution for python (trying to keep this as generic as possible to be easily implemented in other languages). Implementations will be directly based on textbook algorithms. Area is otherwise unmonitored. 
Most (or all) of this will be in Python 3.
